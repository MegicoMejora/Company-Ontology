# Company-Ontology
Semantic Web Project
###Creating and querying an ontology

The goal of this project is to define, populate and query an ontology about Companies. The ontology is be able to integrate and reuse already available semantic data from 2 external sources.

#####Tasks accomplished for this project:

Defined an ontology using Protégé-OWL2;

Populated the knowledge base from an external semantic data repository using SPARQL(1.1).

Verified that it is possible to query the local ontology also using SPARQL.

Populated the ontology with information from the second external semantic data repository so that queries to my local ontology can answer questions that cannot be answered by either remote knowledge base alone.
